# Neovim Config

My neovim configuration for working on sveltekit projects

## Installation

Run this command to get the config up and running:

```sh
gh repo clone Isaachristian/neovim-config ~/.config/nvim
```

### Lua Language Server

In order to get the lua language server working in Fedora 42 running in WSL, I
had install the lua-language-server manually on my computer. I just downloaded
their latest release made the executable executable and added it to my path.
But everything else should just work by default.
